      The complex includes a stupa, various shrines, and temples, some dating back to the Licchavi period.
      A Tibetan monastery, museum, and library have been added more recently.
      The stupa is adorned with Buddha’s eyes and eyebrows painted on it, and the number one (in Nepal script) represents the nose.
      Visitors can explore shops, restaurants, and hostels within the temple premises.
      Access Points:
      
      There are two ways to reach Swayambhu:
      Staircase: A long staircase leads directly to the main platform of the temple from the top of the hill (eastern side).
