        details: `A typical serving of Thakali plate would see Dal, Bhaat, Tarkari and Meat (lentil soup, rice, green vegetable) along with Kanchhemba (Buckwheat finger chips) the Mustang Alu topped with Jimbu (Himalayan leaf garlic) and a generous dollop of ghee (clarified butter). Though it’s low on desserts a sweet curd or Phopké (fermented rice) completes the meal. Vivek Sherchan, Owner, Jimbu Thakali by Capital Grill, who himself is a Thakali from Tukche village of Mustang Region says “the style of preparation of Thakali food is different due to the use of some ingredients that are characteristic of Thakali cuisine like Sukuti or dried goat/yak meat, Gundruk (fermented leafy green vegetables) with soybean along with green cabbage, buckwheat, barley flour and timbur, a spicy Himalayan spice. This gives the cuisine a whole new taste and flavour. The thali is not only appealing in taste but also visually with a variety of colours from the pale green dal, green leafy veggies, rich red meat, rice being white along with the chutneys like mula ko achaar (white radish pickle), chap/golbjeda ko chutney (fresh tomato pickle)”.`
