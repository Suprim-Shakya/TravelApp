        "The Kumari (literally “virgin”) is believed to be the reincarnation of the Hindu warrior goddess Taleju, a manifestation of Durga. Buddhists, on the other hand, believe her to be the tantric goddess Vajradevi. Nepal has several Kumaris, but Kumari Devi, or the Royal Kumari, is the most famous. Selected in early childhood from the Newar Buddhist Sakhya caste of goldsmiths and silversmiths, potential candidates are placed in a darkened room with freshly severed buffalo heads and dancing men wearing demon masks. It is believed if one candidate is not frightened, as most young girls surely would be, she is the next reincarnation of Taleju. Once chosen, she moves into the Kumari Ghar, where her feet will never touch the ground and she’ll only leave during specific festivals and religious duties.Each day, however, she makes occasional appearances from her balcony where crowds below wait to see her. As soon as she begins menstruating, or loses blood from an injury, she reverts back to mortal status and re-enters society, as the selection process begins again.The Kumari Ghar was built in 1757 by King Jaya Prakash Malla when he was overcome in guilt after offending the current Royal Kumari. In an act of atonement, he built her a new home. It was renovated in 1966."

        "The Garden of Dreams, a neo classical historical garden, is situated in the midst of Kathmandu city, Nepal. The Garden's design has much in common with formal European gardens: paved perimeter paths, punctuated by pavilions, trellises, and various planting areas, surrounded by a sunken flower garden with a large pond at its center. It is an architectural landscape that encourages the visitor to stroll around and discover the Garden's treasures from many different vantage points."

        "The Skywalk Tower Kathmandu allows 500 people aboard at a time. However, the company plans to let in only 250 to 300 people in the initial phase. The tower uses 33 mm steel which is a British standard, Shrestha states. Stressing safety, he assures,  “There is no doubt about safety, even the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) and Tourism Department have given permission only after repeated inspections."
